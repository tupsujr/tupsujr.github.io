            <p>Write a short story about something you remember very vividly from your own life, but don't make it
                autobiographical. Make it a central feature in someone else's story and muck up some details to give it
                a
                new flavor without changing what makes it important enough to remember and then write about. Try just
                freewriting (writing whatever comes to your head). If that sounds too daunting, read a newspaper (sorry,
                news site - i am showing my age aren't i) and pick one that sounds interesting and make some shit up. I
                got
                a whole 5 (nearly 6) novel series out of that tactic lol.</p>
